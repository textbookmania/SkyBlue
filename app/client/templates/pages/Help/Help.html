      <h4>Buy Offer</h4>
      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">The Buy Offer page is where students can make an offer to buy an ICS textbook at a given price and condition.  Upon viewing the Buy Offer page, students will see a list of all buy offers made by different users.  To the left of the list is a form where students can make their own buy offer.  They can either submit their buy offer to the list or check to see if there are sell offers that match what they want.  This can be done by clicking on the "Match" button after inputting the textbook they desire to buy.  This will show a list of all the sell offers of that particular textbook.  Entering a buying price and condition will narrow the sell offer list.  Otherwise, the list will be empty if there are no sell offers that match the textbook, price, and/or condition inputted.  However, if they see an offer that they like, they can accept it.  An email or notification will be sent to the user that made the sell offer.</p>
