      <h4>Buy Offer</h4>
      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">The Buy Offer page is where students can make an offer to buy an ICS textbook at a given price.  To do this, students will click on the Add button and pick the textbook they wish to purchase.  They will then be taken to a page that will list all sell offers of the chosen textbook.  From this list, students can choose an offer they want to take and contact the person who made the sell offer.  If there are no sell offers of the chosen textbook or there are no offers they wish to take, they can then make their buy offer and post it to the list of offers.  All buy offers have a deadline in which the offer must be made by.  If the deadline passes, the offer will be taken down from the list of buy offers.  Students may add their offer back onto the list if they wish.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">Students may also edit or delete their buy offer.  To do this, students will click on the Edit button and edit or delete any buy offers they had made.  Students can only edit or delete their own offers.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 15px;">If students wish to view all buy offers made, they can click on the List button.</p>
